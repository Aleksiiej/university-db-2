# C++ Academic Staff Database Project
## Project Overview
This project is aimed at developing a database management system for academic staff using C++ with an object-oriented approach. The primary goal was to enhance skills in C++ programming. The project utilizes CMake for project management, Qt framework for creating the graphical user interface, and nlohmann library for data storage in JSON format. Unit tests were written using the GTest framework. Visual Studio was employed as the integrated development environment (IDE). The program is intended for computers running the Linux operating system.

## Key Features:
- Object-Oriented Design: The system is architected using C++ object-oriented programming, promoting modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
- CMake Integration: Utilizes CMake for project build management, demonstrating proficiency in modern C++ development practices.
- Graphical User Interface: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interaction.
- JSON Data Storage: Utilizes the nlohmann library to store data in JSON format, ensuring compatibility and flexibility.
- Unit Testing with GTest: Incorporates unit tests using the Google Test (GTest) framework, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the code.
- Data Management: Efficient handling of academic staff data, including storage, retrieval, and manipulation functionalities.

## Technical Stack:
- Language: Modern C++ (11, 14, 17) as main programming language for the project
- Build System: CMake used for project management and build automation
- Qt Framework: Employed for creating the graphical user interface.
- nlohmann JSON Library: Utilized for data storage in JSON format.
- Testing Framework: Google Test (GTest)
- Development Tool: Visual Studio Code
- Platform: Linux

## Project Goals:
- C++ Development Skills: Focus on deepening understanding of C++ and its application in real-world software development scenarios.
- Testing and Reliability: Emphasize the importance of writing maintainable and testable code using unit testing frameworks.
- Practical Software Engineering: Provide hands-on experience in designing and implementing a software system from scratch.
- Portfolio Building: Serve as a testament to my software engineering capabilities, suitable for showcasing in a professional context.

## Getting Started:
- Ensure C++ and CMake are installed on your Linux system.
- Clone the repository.
- Use CMake to build the project and run the tests using GTest.
- Run the executable and start managing academic staff data with the program.

## Usage
Upon running the program, the user will be presented with the graphical interface, allowing them to perform various operations related to managing academic staff data. Users can add, edit, delete, and search for academic staff records efficiently.
